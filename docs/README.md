# Document Authoring Guide

Documents that use this authoring workflow are written in the Bikeshed language, which is a mixture of Markdown and HTML. From the Bikeshed inputs, HTML and PDF outputs are automatically generated.

This guide is split into individual chapters, each focusing on a part of the workflow:

* [How to set everything up on your PC](Setup.md)
* [How to write documents](Content.md)
* [How to submit a contribution](Contributor.md)
* [How to accept and publish contributions](Editor.md)
* [How to set up GitHub automation](Administrator.md)
* [How to modify the GitHub and compiler automation](Developer.md)

The source code for this documentation pack and the associated tooling can be found on GitHub.
