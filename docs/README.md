# Document Authoring Guide

Documents that use this authoring workflow are written in the Bikeshed language, which is a mixture of Markdown and HTML. From the Bikeshed inputs, HTML and PDF outputs are automatically generated.

[The Content Guide](Content.md) describes basic features of document content creation that exist.

[The Contributor Guide](Contributor.md) describes how to contribute new content or changes to an existing document.

[The Editor Guide](Editor.md) describes how to review and merge contributions, how to perform editorial changes directly and how to publish new versions of the document.

[The Administrator Guide](Administrator.md) describes how to set up a new document that is to be authored following this guide.

[The Developer Guide](Developer.md) describes the inner workings of the automation and tooling relevant to the document authoring processes.

The source code for this documentation pack and the associated tooling can be found on GitHub.
