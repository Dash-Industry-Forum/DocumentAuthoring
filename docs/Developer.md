# What is what

`BikeshedDocumentAuthoring/` - PowerShell scripts for document compiler. Also used in Azure DevOps builds.

`BikeshedDocumentAuthoring.Automation/` - PowerShell scripts used only in Azure DevOps builds.

# Compatibility notes

The `BikeshedDocumentAuthoring` module is designed to be compatible with both PowerShell Desktop (v5) and PowerShell Core (v6). It should also work on Linux. Probably. It is not often tested on Linux, though - all the Azure DevOps automation uses Windows.

# Automated builds

Every successful automated build of a PowerShell module will publish the PowerShell module to PowerShell gallery.

# PowerShell module versioning

Update the `.psd1` file of a module to change the version number for non-prerelease builds.

For prerelease builds, set `Prerelease = 'yes'` and a suitable prerelease suffix will automatically be generated by the automated build. Set it to empty string for a stable build.

# PowerShell Gallery publishing

The token used for PowerShell Gallery publishing has a 1 year expiration! You must manually update it or new builds will fail.
