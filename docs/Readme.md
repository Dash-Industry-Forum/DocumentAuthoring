# Document Authoring Kit

This is a set of guides for authoring documents on GitHub.

Documents that use this authoring workflow are written in the [Bikeshed language](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#markup-shortcuts) (a mixture of Markdown and HTML), from which HTML and PDF outputs are automatically generated.

[The Formatting Guide](doc/Formatting.md) describes basic features of document content creation that exist.

[The Contributor Guide](doc/Contributor.md) describes how to contribute new content or changes to an existing document.

[The Editor Guide](doc/Editor.md) describes how to review and merge contributions, how to perform editorial changes directly and how to publish new versions of the document.

[The Administrator Guide](doc/Administrator.md) describes how to set up a new document that is to be authored following this guide.

[The Developer Guide](doc/Developer.md) describes the inner workings of the automation and tooling relevant to the document authoring processes.

The source code for this documentation pack and the associated tooling can be found on GitHub.
